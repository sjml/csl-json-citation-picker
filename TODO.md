* detect paper yaml and pull in its libraries automatically :D
* watch file(s) for changes?
* would be nice to have it do a live search as you type, like the Zotero picker
  * I don't think you can with VS Code's UI, though; has to switch between a search and a picker
  * alternative idea: add *everything* to the quickpick? that seems.... bad?
    * couldn't use minisearch to grep through all the fields then, just the UI ones

  * could make a custom UI thing somehow maybe? 
    * probably could do it, but seems to be non-recommended and more trouble than it's worth
